Hi! I'm Oscar. I use this blog to show the projects I'm working on.
I love exploring random real-world datasets and being able to generate meaningful visualisations from them.
Many of my current projects are working with my personal data to gain insights into my subconscious behaviour. 

The current article schedule is a *fortnightly* release. 

If you have any feedback or ideas for new projects, feel free to contact me at one of the links below!
